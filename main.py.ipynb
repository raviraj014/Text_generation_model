       "\"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,\\nAnd sorry I could not travel both\\nAnd be one traveler, long I stood\\nAnd looked down one as far as I could\\nTo where it bent in the undergrowth;\\n\\nThen took the other, as just as fair,\\nAnd having perhaps the better claim,\\nBecause it was grassy and wanted wear;\\nThough as for that the passing there\\nHad worn them really about the same,\\n\\nAnd both that morning equally lay\\nIn leaves no step had trodden black.\\nOh, I kept the first for another day!\\nYet knowing how way leads on to way,\\nI doubted if I should ever come back.\\n\\nI shall be telling this with a sigh\\nSomewhere ages and ages hence:\\nTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I—\\nI took the one less traveled by,\\nAnd that has made all the difference.\\n\\nWhose woods these are I think I know.   \\nHis house is in the village though;   \\nHe will not see me stopping here   \\nTo watch his woods fill up with snow.   \\n\\nMy little horse must think it queer   \\nTo stop without a farmhouse near   \\nBetween the woods and frozen lake   \\nThe darkest evening of the year.   \\n\\nHe gives his harness bells a shake   \\nTo ask if there is some mistake.   \\nThe only other sound’s the sweep   \\nOf easy wind and downy flake.   \\n\\nThe woods are lovely, dark and deep,   \\nBut I have promises to keep,   \\nAnd miles to go before I sleep,   \\nAnd miles to go before I sleep.\\n\\nWhen I see birches bend to left and right\\nAcross the lines of straighter darker trees,\\nI like to think some boy's been swinging them.\\nBut swinging doesn't bend them down to stay\\nAs ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them\\nLoaded with ice a sunny winter morning\\nAfter a rain. They click upon themselves\\nAs the breeze rises, and turn many-colored\\nAs the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.\\nSoon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells\\nShattering and avalanching on the snow-crust—\\nSuch heaps of broken glass to sweep away\\nYou'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.\\nThey are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,\\nAnd they seem not to break; though once they are bowed\\nSo low for long, they never right themselves:\\nYou may see their trunks arching in the woods\\nYears afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground\\nLike girls on hands and knees that throw their hair\\nBefore them over their heads to dry in the sun.\\nBut I was going to say when Truth broke in\\nWith all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm\\nI should prefer to have some boy bend them\\nAs he went out and in to fetch the cows—\\nSome boy too far from town to learn baseball,\\nWhose only play was what he found himself,\\nSummer or winter, and could play alone.\\nOne by one he subdued his father's trees\\nBy riding them down over and over again\\nUntil he took the stiffness out of them,\\nAnd not one but hung limp, not one was left\\nFor him to conquer. He learned all there was\\nTo learn about not launching out too soon\\nAnd so not carrying the tree away\\nClear to the ground. He always kept his poise\\nTo the top branches, climbing carefully\\nWith the same pains you use to fill a cup\\nUp to the brim, and even above the brim.\\nThen he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,\\nKicking his way down through the air to the ground.\\nSo was I once myself a swinger of birches.\\nAnd so I dream of going back to be.\\nIt's when I'm weary of considerations,\\nAnd life is too much like a pathless wood\\nWhere your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs\\nBroken across it, and one eye is weeping\\nFrom a twig's having lashed across it open.\\nI'd like to get away from earth awhile\\nAnd then come back to it and begin over.\\nMay no fate willfully misunderstand me\\nAnd half grant what I wish and snatch me away\\nNot to return. Earth's the right place for love:\\nI don't know where it's likely to go better.\\nI'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,\\nAnd climb black branches up a snow-white trunk\\nToward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,\\nBut dipped its top and set me down again.\\nThat would be good both going and coming back.\\nOne could do worse than be a swinger of birches.\\n\\nBefore man came to blow it right\\n     The wind once blew itself untaught,\\nAnd did its loudest day and night\\n     In any rough place where it caught.\\n \\nMan came to tell it what was wrong:\\n     It hadn’t found the place to blow;\\nIt blew too hard—the aim was song.\\n     And listen—how it ought to go!\\n \\nHe took a little in his mouth,\\n     And held it long enough for north\\nTo be converted into south,\\n     And then by measure blew it forth.\\n \\nBy measure. It was word and note,\\n     The wind the wind had meant to be—\\nA little through the lips and throat.\\n     The aim was song—the wind could see.\\n\\nThe city had withdrawn into itself\\nAnd left at last the country to the country;\\nWhen between whirls of snow not come to lie\\nAnd whirls of foliage not yet laid, there drove\\nA stranger to our yard, who looked the city,\\nYet did in country fashion in that there\\nHe sat and waited till he drew us out\\nA-buttoning coats to ask him who he was.\\nHe proved to be the city come again\\nTo look for something it had left behind\\nAnd could not do without and keep its Christmas.\\nHe asked if I would sell my Christmas trees;\\nMy woods—the young fir balsams like a place\\nWhere houses all are churches and have spires.\\nI hadn’t thought of them as Christmas Trees.\\nI doubt if I was tempted for a moment\\nTo sell them off their feet to go in cars\\nAnd leave the slope behind the house all bare,\\nWhere the sun shines now no warmer than the moon.\\nI’d hate to have them know it if I was.\\nYet more I’d hate to hold my trees except\\nAs others hold theirs or refuse for them,\\nBeyond the time of profitable growth,\\nThe trial by market everything must come to.\\nI dallied so much with the thought of selling.\\nThen whether from mistaken courtesy\\nAnd fear of seeming short of speech, or whether\\nFrom hope of hearing good of what was mine, I said,\\n“There aren’t enough to be worth while.”\\n“I could soon tell how many they would cut,\\nYou let me look them over.”\\n\\n                                                     “You could look.\\nBut don’t expect I’m going to let you have them.”\\nPasture they spring in, some in clumps too close\\nThat lop each other of boughs, but not a few\\nQuite solitary and having equal boughs\\nAll round and round. The latter he nodded “Yes” to,\\nOr paused to say beneath some lovelier one,\\nWith a buyer’s moderation, “That would do.”\\nI thought so too, but wasn’t there to say so.\\nWe climbed the pasture on the south, crossed over,\\nAnd came down on the north. He said, “A thousand.”\\n\\n“A thousand Christmas trees!—at what apiece?”\\n\\nHe felt some need of softening that to me:\\n“A thousand trees would come to thirty dollars.”\\n\\nThen I was certain I had never meant\\nTo let him have them.
